<h1>Interesting Facts About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>My name is <b>Megan Riley Ann Leach</b> and I am 15 years old. I am a freshman at Padua Academy in Wilmington, Delaware. I have many friends that attend Padua with me, including Frankie, Cassidy, Audrey, and more! I also have friends that attend Ursuline, St. Marks, Salesianum, and Archemere. Last year I attended St. Ann School.</p>
    
<p> I have a sister named <b>Abby</b> who is a 16-year-old junior here at Padua Academy. My brother, <b>Brendan</b>, is 18 and is a freshman at St. Joseph's University. I also have a dog named <b>Louie</b> who is a two-year-old golden-doodle.</p>
    
<p>Some of my favorite hobbies are lacrosse, basketball, hanging out with friends, and watching Netflix. However, I have not been able to play any sports because I recently had surgery on my hip. My favorite subjects in school are math and world civ. For my first semester at Padua, I recieved high honors. My favorite book to read is <i>We Were Liars</i>by E. Lockhart. One of my favorite quotes is in the book:</p>
    
<blockquote>"Be a little kinder than you have to." -E. Lockhart</blockquote>

<p>This quote just reminds me that being kind doesn't cost you anyhting, and being a little more kind than you have to is always a good thing to do.</p>
